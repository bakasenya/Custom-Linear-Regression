Custom Linear Regression Implementation-
This repository contains a custom implementation of linear regression using NumPy. The project includes functions for prediction, cost computation, gradient calculation, and gradient descent optimization.

Features-
  Prediction Function (predict): Computes predictions using weights and bias.
  Cost Function (compute_cost): Implements Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance.
  Gradient Computation (compute_gradient): Computes gradients for weight and bias updates.
  Gradient Descent (gradient_descent): Optimizes weights and bias using iterative updates.
